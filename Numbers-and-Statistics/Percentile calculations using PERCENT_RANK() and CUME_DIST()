	Comments on above results:
1) PERCENT_RANK function: calculates the percentile rank of the employees' salary within the company.
This function calculates the relative rank of a row within a group of rows. In other words, it calculates the relative standing of a value within a query set or partition.
In this example, the query set or partition is the whole company.

2) CUME_DIST function: calculates the salary percentile for each employee within the company.
The cumulative distribution (CUME_DIST) calculation returns a value that represents the percentage of employees with a salary less than or equal to the current employee. 

This function calculates the cumulative distribution of a value within a group of values. In other words, it calculates the relative position of a value within a group of values.

Calculation: the cumulative distribution of a value in row R is defined as, the number of rows with values less than or equal to that value in row R, divided by the number of rows evaluated in query set or partition. 
In this example, the query set or partition is the whole company.
