Exercise #1: Create a horizontal histogram for employees by genders.


Solution #1: We create a horizontal histogram for column "Gender" using functions COUNT AND REPLICATE.

Table used: [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

SELECT GENDER
, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
, REPLICATE('*', COUNT(*)) AS EmployeeCountHistogram
FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
GROUP BY GENDER

	-- OUTPUT
GENDER	EmployeeCount	EmployeeCountHistogram
F	84	************************************************************************************
M	206	**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Exercise #2: Create a horizontal histogram for employees by department and genders.


Solution #2.1: We create a horizontal histogram using columns "DepartmentName" and "Gender" using functions COUNT, REPLICATE and ROW_NUMBER.

Tables used:
1) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory]
2) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department]
3) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

SELECT X.DepartmentName
, X.Gender
, REPLICATE('*', COUNT(*)) AS EmployeeCountHistogram 
FROM (
	SELECT EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID
	, EmployeeDeptHistory.DepartmentID
	, EmployeeDeptHistory.ModifiedDate
	, Department.[Name] AS DepartmentName
	, Employee.Gender
	, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID ORDER BY EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID ASC, EmployeeDeptHistory.ModifiedDate DESC) AS RowNumber
	FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] AS EmployeeDeptHistory
	LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department] AS Department
		ON EmployeeDeptHistory.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
	INNER JOIN [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee] AS Employee
		ON EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID = Employee.BusinessEntityID
	) AS X
WHERE RowNumber = 1
GROUP BY X.Gender, X.DepartmentName


	-- OUTPUT
DepartmentName			Gender	EmployeeCountHistogram

	Comment on above results:
1) Subquery X was created to:
a) obtain the Department Name by joining together tables [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] and [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department],
b) remove 5 duplicated BusinessEntityIDs from these 2 tables by using Window Function ROW_NUMBER().

2) There are 5 BusinessEntityIDs that appear more than once after we join together tables [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] and [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department].

SELECT EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID
, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
, REPLICATE('*', COUNT(*)) AS EmployeeCountHistogram
FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] AS EmployeeDeptHistory
LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department] AS Department
	ON EmployeeDeptHistory.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
GROUP BY EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY EmployeeDeptHistory.BusinessEntityID

	-- OUTPUT
BusinessEntityID	EmployeeCount	EmployeeCountHistogram
4			2		**
16			2		**
224			2		**
234			2		**
250			3		***
