Exercise #1: Retrieve the start and end dates for a specific quarter using 


Solution #1: Retrieve the start and end dates for a specific quarter using functions MODULUS (%), DATEADD, MONTH, DAY, CAST, LEFT and UNION ALL operator

Table used: [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]

	Query #1: 
	---------
SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, -2, Z.FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter) AS DateFirstDayOfQuarter		-- StartEndDatesQuarterLevel4
, DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, Z.FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter)) AS DateLastDayOfQuarter
FROM (
	SELECT CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) AS YearOfLastMonthOfQuarter					-- GenerateDateOfLastMonthOfQuarterLevel3
	, CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) AS MonthOfLastMonthOfQuarter

	, CAST(CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) + '-' + CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) + '-1' AS DATE) AS FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter
	FROM (
		SELECT LEFT(X.YRQ, 4) AS [YEAR]										-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
		, X.YRQ % 10 AS [QUARTER]
		, X.YRQ % 10 * 3 AS [MONTH]

	-- OUTPUT

Below are the queries used step-by-step for this solution.

	Query #1.1: We generate 4 rows for the year and each of the 4 quarters of the year 2024 using UNION ALL operator
	-----------
SELECT DISTINCT 20241 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1 
	UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT 20242 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
	UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT 20243 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
	UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT 20244 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1


	-- OUTPUT
YRQ
20241
20242
20243
20244
(end of results)
(4 rows affected)




	Query #1.2: We generate separate each quarter using function MODULUS and UNION ALL operator
	-----------
SELECT LEFT(X.YRQ, 4) AS [YEAR]							-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
, X.YRQ % 10 AS [QUARTER]
, X.YRQ % 10 * 3 AS [MONTH]
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT 20241 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1 
		UNION ALL
	SELECT DISTINCT 20242 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
		UNION ALL
	SELECT DISTINCT 20243 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
		UNION ALL
	SELECT DISTINCT 20244 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1
) AS X										-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2


	-- OUTPUT
YEAR	QUARTER		MONTH
2024	1		3
2024	2		6
2024	3		9
2024	4		12
(end of results)
(4 rows affected)

We use function Modulus to create all 4 quarters and their respective months.




	Query #1.3: We generate the first day of the last month for each quarter
	-----------
SELECT CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) AS YearOfLastMonthOfQuarter			-- GenerateDateOfLastMonthOfQuarterLevel3
, CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) AS MonthOfLastMonthOfQuarter
, CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) + '-' + CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) + '-1' AS DateOfLastMonthOfQuarterCAST
, CAST(CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) + '-' + CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) + '-1' AS DATE) AS FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter
FROM (
	SELECT LEFT(X.YRQ, 4) AS [YEAR]								-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
	, X.YRQ % 10 AS [QUARTER]
	, X.YRQ % 10 * 3 AS [MONTH]
	FROM (
		SELECT DISTINCT 20241 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1 
			UNION ALL
		SELECT DISTINCT 20242 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
			UNION ALL
		SELECT DISTINCT 20243 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]
			UNION ALL
		SELECT DISTINCT 20244 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]		-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1
	) AS X											-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
) AS Y										-- GenerateDateOfLastMonthOfQuarterLevel3


	-- OUTPUT
YearOfLastMonthOfQuarter	MonthOfLastMonthOfQuarter	DateOfLastMonthOfQuarterCAST	FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter
2024				3				3/1/2024			3/1/2024
2024				6				6/1/2024			6/1/2024
2024				9				9/1/2024			9/1/2024
2024				12				12/1/2024			12/1/2024
(end of results)

	Query #1.4: We use column "FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter" from Query #1.3 to generate columns (1) DateFirstDayOfQuarter and (2) DateLastDayOfQuarter
	-----------
SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, -2, Z.FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter) AS DateFirstDayOfQuarter		-- StartEndDatesQuarterLevel4
, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, Z.FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter) AS FirstDayNextQuarter
, DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, Z.FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter)) AS DateLastDayOfQuarter
FROM (
	SELECT CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) AS YearOfLastMonthOfQuarter					-- GenerateDateOfLastMonthOfQuarterLevel3
	, CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) AS MonthOfLastMonthOfQuarter
	, CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) + '-' + CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) + '-1' AS DateOfLastMonthOfQuarterCAST
	, CAST(CAST(Y.[YEAR] AS VARCHAR) + '-' + CAST(Y.[MONTH] AS VARCHAR) + '-1' AS DATE) AS FirstDayOfLastMonthOfQuarter
	FROM (
		SELECT LEFT(X.YRQ, 4) AS [YEAR]										-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
		, X.YRQ % 10 AS [QUARTER]
		, X.YRQ % 10 * 3 AS [MONTH]
		FROM (
			SELECT DISTINCT 20241 AS YRQ FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[BusinessEntity]				-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterLevel1

		) AS X													-- Generate4RowsYearQuarterMonthLevel2
	) AS Y												-- GenerateDateOfLastMonthOfQuarterLevel3
) AS Z										-- DateLastDayOfQuarterLevel4


	-- OUTPUT
DateFirstDayQuarter	FirstDayNextQuarter	DateLastDayOfQuarter
