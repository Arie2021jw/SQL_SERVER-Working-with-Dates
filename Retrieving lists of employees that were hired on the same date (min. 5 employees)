Exercise #1: Retrieve the list of employees that were hired on the same date and at least other 4 employees were hired on the same date.


Solution #1: We retrieve the list employees that were hired on the same date along with at least other 4 employees using a Cartesian Product and functions DATENAME, YEAR, MONTH, WEEK, WEEKDAY, COUNT.

Table used: [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

	Query #1: We retrieve the list of employees that were hired on the same date along with at least other 4 employees using a Cartesian Product
	---------
SELECT X.EmpIDA						-- EmployeesHireSameDateAtLeast5EmployeesLevel3 / CountEmployeesHiredOnSameDatesLevel2
, X.EmpJobTitleA
, COUNT(X.EmpIDA) AS NumberEmployeesHiredSameDay
FROM 
(
	SELECT DISTINCT A.BusinessEntityID AS EmpIDA						-- EmployeesHiredOnSameDatesLevel1
	, A.JobTitle AS EmpJobTitleA
	, A.HireDate AS EmpHireDateA
	, B.BusinessEntityID AS EmpIDB
	, B.JobTitle AS EmpJobTitleB
	, B.HireDate AS EmpHireDateB
	FROM	[AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee] AS A, 
		[AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee] AS B
	WHERE DATENAME(YEAR, A.HireDate) = DATENAME(YEAR, B.HireDate)
		AND DATENAME(MONTH, A.HireDate) = DATENAME(MONTH, B.HireDate) 
		AND DATENAME(WEEK, A.HireDate) = DATENAME(WEEK, B.HireDate)
		AND DATENAME(WEEKDAY, A.HireDate) = DATENAME(WEEKDAY, B.HireDate)
		AND A.BusinessEntityID <= B.BusinessEntityID					-- EmployeesHiredOnSameDatesLevel1
	) AS X
GROUP BY X.EmpIDA, X.EmpJobTitleA						-- CountEmployeesHiredOnSameDatesLevel2
HAVING COUNT(X.EmpIDA) >= 5				-- EmployeesHireSameDateAtLeast5EmployeesLevel3


	-- OUTPUT
EmpIDA		EmpJobTitleA				NumberEmployeesHiredSameDay

To retrieve only the employees that were hired on the same date along with at least other 4 employees, we would need to add the HAVING clause "HAVING COUNT(X.EmpIDA) >= 5" to Query #1.2.
See the desired output on Query #1.
