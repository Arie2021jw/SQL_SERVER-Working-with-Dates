Exercise #1: Calculate the first day of the current month.


Solution #1: Below are 4 ways to calculate the first day of the current month.
To calculate we use functions GETGATE, DAY, MONTH, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, EOMONTH and date 1900-01-01 (default value for SQL Server's data type DATETIME).


Solution #1.1, Query #1.1: We calculate the first day of the current month using functions GETGATE, DAY.
--------------------------
SELECT CAST(GETDATE() - DAY(GETDATE()) + 1 AS DATE) AS FirstDayofCurrentMonth


	Explanation:
	------------
SELECT CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) AS TodayGetDate
, - DAY(GETDATE()) AS Step1
, - DAY(GETDATE()) + 1 AS Step2
, CAST(GETDATE() - DAY(GETDATE()) + 1 AS DATE) AS Step3_FirstDayofCurrentMonth


	-- OUTPUT
TodayGetDate	Step1	Step2	Step3_FirstDayofCurrentMonth
2024-12-02	-2	-1	2024-12-01
(end of results)
(1 row affected)

	Comments on above results:
Step1: We calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the current month using function DAY. Then,
Step3: We subtract this number to today's date (obtained via function GETDATE) and add 1, to get our result.




Solution #1.2, Query #1.2: We calculate the first day of the current month using functions DATEADD, DAY, GETDATE.
--------------------------
SELECT CAST(DATEADD(DAY, -(DAY(GETDATE() - 1)),GETDATE()) AS DATE) AS FirstDayofCurrentMonth


	Explanation:
	------------
SELECT CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) AS TodayGetDate
, DAY(GETDATE()) AS Step1

, CAST(DATEADD(MONTH, 0, -1) AS DATE) AS Step2
, CAST(DATEADD(MONTH,DATEDIFF(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()),-1) AS DATE) AS Step3_LastDayofCurrentMonth


	-- OUTPUT
TodayGetDate	Step1	Step2		Step3_LastDayofCurrentMonth
2024-12-02	1500	1899-12-31	2024-12-31
(end of results)
(1 row affected)

	Comments on above results:
Step1: We calculate the (difference) number of months between SQL Server's default value for data type DATETIME Minus One Month and today's date. 
SQL Server's data type DATETIME (1900-01-01 00:00:00) = 1900-01-01 00:00:00.000
SQL Server's data type DATETIME Minus One Month is 1899-12-01 = 1899-12-01 00:00:00.000
1,500 months = number of months between 1899-12-01 and today's date.


	 Query #2.2.1: 
	--------------
SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, 0, 0) AS DefaultValueDataTypeDATETIME_1900_01_01
SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, -1, 0) AS DefaultValueDataTypeDATETIME_Minus_OneMonth_1899_12_01

	-- OUTPUT #1:
DefaultValueDataTypeDATETIME_1900_01_01
1900-01-01 00:00:00.000
