Exercise #1: Count the number of employees hired every month of every year, and including the months were no employees were hired.


Solution #1: Count the number of employees hired every month of every year using functions GENERATE_SERIES, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DAY, MONTH, DATEPART, MIN, MAX, CAST

Table used: [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

	Query #1: 
	---------
SELECT W.GeneratedDates						-- CountHireDatesLevel3 / CountHireDatesLevel2
, SUM(CASE	WHEN Employee.FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate IS NOT NULL 
		THEN 1
		ELSE 0
		END
	) AS CountHireDates
FROM ( 
	(
	SELECT										-- GenerateDatesBetweenFirstAndLastHireDateLevel1
	CAST(DATEADD(DAY, value, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MIN(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0))) AS DATE) AS GeneratedDates
	FROM GENERATE_SERIES(0
				 , DATEDIFF(DAY
					, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MIN(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0))
					, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MAX(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0)))
				, 1) 							-- GenerateDatesBetweenFirstAndLastHireDateLevel1
	) AS W	
	LEFT JOIN 
	(
	SELECT DATEADD(DAY, -(DAY(HireDate) - 1), HireDate) AS FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
	FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
	) AS Employee
		ON W.GeneratedDates = Employee.FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
)
WHERE DATEPART(DAY, W.GeneratedDates) = 1							-- CountHireDatesLevel2
GROUP BY W.GeneratedDates
ORDER BY W.GeneratedDates						-- CountHireDatesLevel3

Below are the queries used step-by-step for this solution.



	Query #1.1: We retrieve the first and last employee hired from table [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
	-----------
SELECT MIN(HireDate) AS FirstHireDate FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

SELECT MAX(HireDate) AS LastHireDate FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]


	-- OUTPUT #1:
FirstHireDate
2006-06-30
(end of results)
(1 row affected)

	-- OUTPUT #2:
LastHireDate
2013-05-30
(end of results)
(1 row affected)




	Query #1.2: We generate the list of dates between the months of first and last hire dates using function GENERATE_SERIES
	-----------
SELECT						-- GenerateDatesBetweenFirstAndLastHireDateLevel1
CAST(DATEADD(DAY, value, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MIN(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0))) AS DATE) AS GeneratedDates
FROM GENERATE_SERIES(0
		     , DATEDIFF(DAY
				, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MIN(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0))
				, (SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, (SELECT MAX(HireDate) FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee])), 0)))
		    , 1)			-- GenerateDatesBetweenFirstAndLastHireDateLevel1


	-- OUTPUT
GeneratedDates
2006-06-01
2006-06-02
2006-06-03

2013-05-01
(end of results)
(2527 rows affected)




	Query #1.3: We calculate the first day of the month for every Hiredate from table [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
	-----------
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, -(DAY(HireDate) - 1), HireDate) AS FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]

	-- OUTPUT
FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
2006-06-01
2007-01-01
2007-11-01
2007-12-01
2007-12-01

2012-05-01
2012-05-01
2012-09-01
2013-03-01
2013-05-01
2013-05-01
(end of results)
(290 rows affected)

There are 290 employees, each one with a HireDate, therefore, we get 290 rows.





	Query #1.3.1: We calculated the FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate on Query #1.3 using the logic of the below query.
	-------------
SELECT CAST(DATEADD(DAY, -(DAY(GETDATE() - 1)),GETDATE()) AS DATE) AS FirstDayofCurrentMonth


	Query #1.3.2: Below we show step-by-step how we applied the above logic to column HireDate
	-------------
SELECT HireDate
, DAY(HireDate) AS DayOfHireDate
, DAY(HireDate) - 1  AS DayOfHireDateMinus1
, -(DAY(HireDate) - 1)  AS DayOfHireDateMinus1MultipliedByMinus1
, DATEADD(DAY, -(DAY(HireDate) - 1), HireDate) AS FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
FROM [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
ORDER BY HireDate


	-- OUTPUT
HireDate	DayOfHireDate	DayOfHireDateMinus1	DayOfHireDateMinus1MultipliedByMinus1	FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate
2006-06-30	30		29			-29					2006-06-01

To count the number of employees hired every month from Query #1.5 we would need to:
a) remove column "Employee.FirstDayOfMonthOfHireDate",
b) add a SUM function to column "CountHireDates", and
c) add a GROUP BY clause on column W.GeneratedDates.

See the desired output on Query #1.
